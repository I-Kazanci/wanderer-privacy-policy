# Privacy Policy (Wanderer)

**Last updated:** 2026-02-03

Wanderer (“the App”) is a mobile application that allows users to keep track of cities they have visited and share comments about those cities. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the App.

## 1. Information We Collect
We may collect and store the following categories of information:

- **Account information:** email address (used for authentication) and a unique user ID.
- **Profile information:** username, title, biography, and avatar. Avatars and titles are provided within the App; users do not upload personal photos.
- **App activity & content:** visited cities, ratings, wishlist items, achievements/titles, and friend connections (if social features are used). We do not request or track precise device location (GPS); city data is based solely on user input.
- **Comments:** content you choose to post as comments on city pages. The App does not support direct user-to-user messaging.

We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
We use your information to:
- Create and manage user accounts
- Provide core App features (profiles, city tracking, ratings, comments, and social features)
- Maintain the security and integrity of the App
- Prevent abuse and enforce App policies

## 3. Sharing of Information
We do not sell your personal information.

We may share information only:
- With service providers necessary to operate the App (see Section 4)

- **Cloud Firestore** for storing profiles, city interactions, social data, and city comments

We do **not** use Firebase Analytics or Crashlytics.

Firebase may process certain technical or device-related data as described in Google’s privacy documentation.

## 5. Data Retention
We retain personal data as long as your account is active or as necessary to provide the service.
You may request deletion of your data as described in Section 7.

City comments may remain visible unless removed for moderation purposes or upon account deletion.

## 6. Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information. No system is completely secure, but we take appropriate steps to safeguard your data.
